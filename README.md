Team Members:

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create Tic-Tac-Toe using the model driven development application of dime.

Game Description:
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. First player is X, second player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
