            This suppresses a false positive identified on org.apache.james:apache-mime4j-dom which is a dependency of
            org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-multipart-provider.

            CVE-2021-40525 refers to Apache James ManagedSieves: "Apache James ManagedSieve implementation
            alongside with the file storage for sieve scripts is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing reading and
            writing any file." https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40525

            Since MVN repository (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.james/apache-mime4j-dom/0.8.3)
            doesn't list CVE-2021-40525 as a direct vulnerability of org.apache.james:apache-mime4j-dom,
            we consider it a false positive.
